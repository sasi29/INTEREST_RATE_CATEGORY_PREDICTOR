# LOAN_CATEGORY_PREDICTOR
This project is to predict the interest category. On one hand, knowing the interest rate category will help consumers and borrowers to increase their credit worthiness and place themselves in a better position to negotiate for getting a lower interest rate. On the other hand, this will help lending companies to get an immediate fixed interest rate estimation based on client’s information.
So, In this project the XGBOOST and CATBOOST models are developed after performing data cleaning, data visulization. For building UI catboost model is used.
